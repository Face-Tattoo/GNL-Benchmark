# :sparkles: What's get_next_line?

The aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line, read from a file descriptor.

# :clipboard: List of Archives
<h3 align=center>Standard</h3>
<i>In this files, you will find GNL using standard lists and recursive function that's using `strjoin` and other function from libft.</i>


<h3 align=center>Linked List</h3>
<i>In this files, you will find GNL using linked list thats is a recourse that's more efficient that the standard list from `C`, we learn about it in the bonus of the libft, and this is probably more efficient.</i>



## Functions from Standard

- [`get_next_line`](GNL/get_next_line.c)	- all non-libft functions that's necessary to run the GNL.
- [`get_next_line_utils`](GNL/get_next_line_utils.c)	- all functions from libft that's necessary to run the GNL.
- [`get_next_line header`](GNL/get_next_line.h)		- the header of the GNL.

## Functions from Linked List

- [`get_next_line`](GNLinked/get_next_line.c)	- all non-libft functions that's necessary to run the GNL.
- [`get_next_line_utils`](GNLinked/get_next_line_utils.c)	- all functions from libft that's necessary to run the GNL.
- [`get_next_line header`](GNLinked/get_next_line.h)		- the header of the GNL.

# Clone the Repo
$ git clone https://github.com/luizlcezario/get_next_line.git

# Enter in the Folder
$ cd get_next_line

# *************COMMANDS************ #
# what of the to GNLs you want to test entry in the folder
$ cd GNL or cd GNLinked


# for test with the example_main.c you need to copy the example_main.c
#folder the folder and than rename to main.c and run the comamand below.
